    <p>Input node for Raspberry Pi & ESP. Generates a <code>msg.payload</code> with either a
    0 or 1 depending on the state of the input pin.</p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>the payload will be a 1 or a 0.</dd>
        <dt>topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the topic will be set to <code>gpio/{the bcm spio number}</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>You may also enable the input pullup resistor or the pulldown resistor for RPi.</p>
    <p>Requires the RPi.GPIO python library version 0.5.10 (or better) in order to work with RPI.</p>
    <p>Requires the Moddable SDK in order to work with ESP.</p>

    <p>Output node for Raspberry Pi & ESP. Can be used in Digital or PWM modes.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">number | string | boolean</span></dt>
    </dl>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Digital mode - expects a <code>msg.payload</code> with either a 0 or 1 (or true or false),
    and will set the selected physical pin high or low depending on the value passed in.</p>
    <p>The initial value of the pin at deploy time can also be set to 0 or 1.</p>
    <p>PWM mode - expects an input value of a number 0 - 100. It can be floating point.</p>
    <p>PWM mode can be used to drive a servo using input values between 10 and 20 only,
    but will accept floating point values.
    For Raspberry Pi, the GPIO2 pin is best for this as it uses hardware to do the PWM. For better servo support
    consider the alternative node-red-node-pi-gpiod node.</p>
    <p>Requires the RPi.GPIO python library version 0.5.10 (or better) in order to work with RPI.</p>
    <p>Requires the Moddable SDK in order to work with ESP.</p>
